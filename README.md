Some fun with [Reprocessing](https://github.com/schmavery/reprocessing) and [BsbNative](https://github.com/bsansouci/bsb-native)

## How To

### Install

`yarn`

### Build

`yarn build` and `yarn vite:build`

### Start

There are a few ways to try this out:

After building you could run a static server, like `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and go to `localhost:8000`. Or you're using safari you can simply open the `index.html` and tick `Develop > Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions`.

Alternatively using Vite: `yarn preview` will host the game at `localhost:4173`

### Controls

Use the arrow keys to turn and brake, whilst space restarts the game. Alternatively, click/touch
the edges to turn and the timer to restart.
